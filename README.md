# K-Means-Clustering-Java
The K-Means clustering algorithm is widely utilized in various fields, including data analysis, image processing, and pattern recognition. It is an iterative algorithm that aims to group similar data points into clusters, where the similarity is measured based on the Euclidean distance between data points.
